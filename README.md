### What Is AstraERP Community (Custom Fork)

**AstraERP Community** is a **working fork of MixERP** — an open-source ERP solution built with ASP.NET and PostgreSQL, designed for small and medium enterprises.

This fork focuses on **custom development**, extending MixERP with:

* A **built-in Kanban board**
* **Online Order Management**
* A **Shipping module**

Together, these provide a more integrated experience for businesses managing sales, logistics, and fulfillment.
