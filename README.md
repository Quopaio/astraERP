This repository is a **working fork** of the MixERP project — an ASP.NET, PostgreSQL-based open source ERP solution for small and medium enterprises.  
Our focus is on **custom development** to extend MixERP with a **built-in Online Order Management and Shipping module**, providing an integrated experience for businesses that manage sales, logistics, and fulfillment.
