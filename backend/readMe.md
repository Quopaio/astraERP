## 📂 MixERP.Domain

* **What it is:** Your **core business objects** (Entities, Value Objects, Domain Events, Interfaces).
* **Why:** Should have no dependencies on anything else. Pure C# classes + interfaces.

---

## 📂 MixERP.Application

* **What it is:** The **application services** layer. Think *“use cases”* or *“what the system does.”*
* **Contents:**

  * Command & Query handlers (CQRS pattern).
  * Interfaces for persistence or external services (implemented in Infrastructure).
  * Validation, orchestration between domain objects.
* **Why:** Keeps workflows out of the API controllers.
  Example: “CreateInvoiceHandler” lives here — it uses `IInvoiceRepository` (interface in Domain) but knows nothing about EF Core or SQL.

---

## 📂 MixERP.Infrastructure

* **What it is:** Actual implementations that touch the outside world:

  * EF Core DbContexts + Migrations.
  * Repository implementations.
  * File storage, email, logging adapters.
* **Why:** Swappable, testable. It implements the interfaces defined in `Domain` or `Application`.

## 📂 MirERP.API

* **What it is:** The delivery layer (presentation, endpoints).
* **Contents:**

  * Controllers or Minimal APIs.
  * Startup/Program.cs.
  * Dependency injection wiring.
* **Why:** Should be very thin: just receives requests, hands them to `Application` commands/queries, returns responses.

---

## ⚡ So why `Application` matters

* Without it, your API controllers often end up bloated (business logic sneaks in there).
* `Application` gives you a place to put:

  * **CQRS commands/queries** (MediatR is common here).
  * **Use case services** (like `RegisterCustomer`, `ProcessOrder`).
  * **Pipeline behaviors** (logging, validation, transactions).
* It makes testing easier: you can test use cases **without spinning up the API**.

---

### ✨ Example flow

* `POST /api/customers`
* Controller (API) → calls `CreateCustomerCommandHandler` (Application).
* Handler uses domain objects (from Domain) and repository interfaces.
* Repository is implemented in Infrastructure (e.g. EF Core).
* Application returns a result → API sends response.
